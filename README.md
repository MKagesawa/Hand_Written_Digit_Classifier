# Hand_Written_Digit_Classifier
Using Neural Network to classify hand written digits from 0 ~ 9



Given a data set with 5000 handwritten digits and their corresponding labels. 

Each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. 

Each pixel is represented by a number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. 

Thus, the neural network will have 400 inputs.

The network will consist of an input layer with 400 inputs, a hidden layer with 25 units, and a softmax layer producing a 
probability distribution over the ten digits.

Each hidden unit uses a logistic activation function.
